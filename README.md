## Overview

MusicalAid is a web-based application designed to assist users in learning and identifying musical notes. It provides two key tools to help with music theory and note recognition:

1. **Note Detection Tool**: This tool can identify and display musical notes from an uploaded audio clip or sound. It's useful for tuning instruments or creating a musical sheet based on the sound.
   
2. **Musical Knowledge Test**: This tool challenges users to identify the note displayed in an image. It's a fun way to test and improve your knowledge of musical notes and their recognition.

## Features

- **Note Detection Tool**: Helps users detect musical notes from audio. Useful for musicians who want to tune their instruments or create sheet music based on sounds.
- **Guess the Note Game**: Users are shown a picture of a musical note and need to guess its name (e.g., `C#`, `A`, `F`). This is a helpful game to test musical knowledge.
- **Interactive Interface**: The app is easy to use, with interactive buttons and input fields.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool works well across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
